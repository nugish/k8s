# Cert-Manager
[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/)  adds certificates and certificate issuers as resource types in Kubernetes clusters, and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing and using those certificates.

It can issue certificates from a variety of supported sources, including Letâ€™s Encrypt, HashiCorp Vault, and Venafi as well as private PKI.
